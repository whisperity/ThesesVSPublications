# `\ThesesVSPublications`: LaTeX support for creating thesis/reference association matrices

The `thesesvspublications` package allow the creation of bibliography association matrices in an clear and concise fashion, without having to deal with manually generating and modifying the tables while working.
By simply specifying the theses (rows) and the publications (columns) and the association between them, the `\ThesesVSPublications` command generates a table that is similar in nature to:


|  Thesis name             | [1] | [2] | [3] |
|:-------------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1. Awesome thesis        |  •  |  •  |     |
| 2. The Standard Model    |     |  •  |  •  |
